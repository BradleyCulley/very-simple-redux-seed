// export const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';

/* Note: purposefully leaving this file in the project, and the above line of code commented out.
A good learning progression for organization of actions is switching from the string literal 'INCREMENT'
as the action type to:
 step 1: exporting a const with the value 'INCREMENT', as an action type
 step 2: in addition to step 1, exporting an "action creator" that returns an action with the type set to the value
 of the INCRCEMENT const.

 And of course, for both of the above, updating the rest of the codebase accordingly.
